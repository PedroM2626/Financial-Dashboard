- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/PedroM2626/Financial-Dashboard/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and description.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users.
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs if relevant.

### Your First Code Contribution

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine.
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch.
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
